abstract = {Perturbation is an operation defined on the simplex and can be used for centering compositional data in a ternary diagram, applying objective criteria. Because a straight line in the original diagram is still astraight line in the perturbed diagram, gridlines or compositional fields defined by straight lines can easily be included in the operation. Simultaneous perturbation of data, gridlines, and/or compositional fields is shown to improve both visualization and graphical interpretation of compositions in ternary diagrams. This is illustrated by some examples using simulated as well as real data.},

abstract = {Most designers know that yellow text presented against a blue background reads clearly and easily, but how many can explain why, and what really are the best ways to help others and ourselves clearly see key patterns in a bunch of data? This book explores the art and science of why we see objects the way we do. Based on the science of perception and vision, the author presents the key principles at work for a wide range of applications-resulting in visualization of improved clarity, utility, and persuasiveness. The book offers practical guidelines that can be applied by anyone: interaction designers, graphic designers of all kinds (including web designers), data miners, and financial analysts.First work to use the science of perception to help serious designers and analysts optimize understanding and perception of their data visualizations. Major revision of this classic work, with a new chapter on visual thinking, new sections on face perception and flow visualization, and a much expanded chapter on color and color sequences. New to this edition is the full color treatment throughout, to better display over 400 illustrations.},

abstract = {Literature that describes the prevalence of inherited red-green color deficiency in different populations is reviewed. Large random population surveys show that the prevalence of deficiency in European Caucasians is about 8{\%} in men and about 0.4{\%} in women and between 4{\%} and 6.5{\%} in men of Chinese and Japanese ethnicity. However, the male: female prevalence ratio is markedly different in Europeans and Asians. Recent surveys suggest that the prevalence is rising in men of African ethnicity and in geographic areas that have been settled by incoming migrants. It is proposed that founder events and genetic drift, rather than natural selection, are the cause of these differences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Lexis surface plot is an established visualization tool in demography. Its present utility, however, is limited to the domain of one-dimensional magnitudes such as rates and counts. Visualizing proportions among three or more groups on a period-age grid is an unsolved problem. OBJECTIVE We seek to extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data. METHODS We propose four techniques for visualizing group compositions on a period-age grid. To demonstrate the techniques we use data on age-specific cause-of-death compositions in France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple desired criteria. RESULTS Compositional data can effectively be visualized on the Lexis surface. A key feature of the classical Lexis surface plot – to show age, period, and cohort patterns – is retained in the domain of compositions. The optimal choice among the four proposed techniques depends primarily on the number of groups making up the composition and whether or not the plot should be readable by people with impaired colour vision. CONTRIBUTION We introduce techniques for visualizing compositional data on a period-age grid to the field of demography and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques by performing an exploratory analysis of age-specific French cause-of-death patterns across the 20th century. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the four proposed techniques. We contribute a technique to construct the ternary-balance colour scheme from within a per- ceptually uniform colour space.},

@inproceedings{Stott2003,
abstract = {Soil has four basic components: organic and inorganic matter, water and air. Soil texture is an expression of the composition of the inorganic matter in a soil and it affects soil behaviour (e.g. infiltration, fertility, susceptibility to erosion, soil structure). The knowledge of soil texture is fundamental to the interpretation of soils capabilities. Moreover, most soil taxonomic classification systems (USDA, FAO, South Africa, Australian, etc.) specify with more or less detail the dominant soil texture (e.g. the percentage of sand, silt and clay particles). There is a lack of standards for cartographic presentation of soil maps, unlike in geology where the adoption of colours for different geologic units is standardised, selection of colours for representing different soil types is often arbitrary. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new method for cartographic representation of soil maps based on spectral encoding of soil texture using a trivariate colour scheme. The visualization method involves extending the U.S.D.A. soil textural triangle by assigning one substrative primary colour (e.g. yellow, magenta and cyan) to each axis of the triangle. In this way a unique colour hue is generated for each possible textural class used in soil classification. The trivariate spectral encoding can be applied in either a continuos or discrete manner. For each soil unit, its color can be selected from the exact textural composition (e.g. laboratory determinations of clay, silt and sand percentages), creating a continous spectral encoding. Conversely, spectral encoding can also be applied in a discrete manner by assigning the colour representative of the textural family (e.g. loamy, silty, sandy loam textures). Such colour is defined by the middle point of the polygon representing that particular textural class. Because of this, the trivariate spectral encoding can be applied to the different taxonomic systems used by soil survey organisation worldwide, making it an adaptable and robust scheme.},

abstract = {When color is used "appropriately" on a map, the organization of the perceptual dimensions of color corresponds to the logical organization in the mapped data. A color scheme typology is presented here that matches a comprehensive listing of the ways in which data are organized to corresponding organizations of hue and lightness, with secondary attention to saturation. Appropriate use of color for data display allows interrelationships and patterns within data to be easily visualized. The careless use of color will obscure these patterns. Careful use of color on maps is particularly important in interactive and animated map contexts, where the map reader must attend to changing patterns on the maps and has little time to look back and forth to a map legend, if one is offered at all. A spontaneously under- stood color scheme is a great asset in these contexts.},
